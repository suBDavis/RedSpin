<p>Hiya!  My name is Brandon Davis.  I'm a computer science student at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  I like to struggle with Java, PHP, and Python, and sometimes I even end up with runnable programs.  I am particularly interested in Linux and networking.  I also tinker with electronics and I'm pretty fond of the Arduino platform.<br><br>

Since fall of 2013, I've also been involved in managing a public Minecraft server we call RedspinMC.  I created it mainly as a technology project, and never really intended to get involed in the daily operations.  these days, I actually enjoy handling player issues and planning fun events or new developments that the players can enjoy.  More info on that at <a href="http://rsmc.tk">rsmc.tk</a><br><br>

This blog is mainly a place for me to collect my thoughts and keep track of the various projects I do and what I learn from them (becasue otherwise, I would almost certainly forget).  Normally my articles are about technology, but sometimes personal stuff turns up here too.
