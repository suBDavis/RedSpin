Python CLI Connect Four

<p>Today I spent the majority of my free time creating a Connect Four game for the command line.  I had the random idea for it and spent some time trying to figure out my method before beginning.  I am a novice at Python so most of my problems lay in trying to figure out the syntax.  Whenever I do any programming, I tend to have about thirty different tabs of Google open.  You can see my end result here.</p>
