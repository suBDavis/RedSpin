How and Why to host your own blog

<p>I've been working on this site for the last several weeks.  I migrated to complete independence from all blogging platforms for a few reasons, which I will outline in the first section.  After that, I'll talk a bit about the way that I went about making a semi-flexible blog from a seemingly static site without all the nice features that a platform like blogger, wordpress, suvtle, or medium might offer.</p>
<h3>Why just do it yourself?</h3>
<p>Curious, hmm?  Why would I forfeit the SEO and ease-of-access advantages of cloud platforms for a less aesthetic site that took more effort to update?</p>

<p>I'm a bit of a control freak when it comes to managing my own content.  

The second is that I wanted to force myself to learn as I went along.  HTML and CSS will stick around a lot longer than the nuances of configuring blogging platforms to bend to your will.

Finally, I wanted to own my content.  With cloud platforms, your words are never really yours.

<h3>So how did you do it?</h3>
