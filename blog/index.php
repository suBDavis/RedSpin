<p>My Arduino UNO has been in the closet since late last year.  I bought the board to teach myself something new, but soon became too busy and uninterested to tinker.  Now, with less than a week left before I go to college, I decided to get it out and take on my biggest electronics project ever.<br><br>

I have no idea how it originally came about, but I have been wanting a funky clock for quite some time.  Now that I am trying to gather some unique artifacts for my dorm room, I couldn't think of a better thing to have on my shelf than a custom built binary clock.  I mean - the girls love those right?</p>

<h3><span class="bloghead"><a href="social-media.php">The Devolution of Social Media </a></span><date>Jul 19, 2013</date></h3>
<p>There seems to be a trend in social media these days.  There have been no new sites that aim to provide a multitude of functions all wrapped into one experience, at least since the launch of Google+, and not successfully since the launch of internet empire Facebook .  Instead we are seeing services come out that provide only a few or even a single function.  A shining example of the devolution of social media is Vine, a program from independent developers that was purchased by Twitter.  With Vine, the user can create 6 second choppy videos and post them to their Vine and Twitter feeds as well as Facebook.  Instagram, a photo and video sharing application, has a very similar function.  Ask.fm is another very straightforward site whose sole purpose is to allow users to be asked questions by other users or anonymously.</p>

<h3><span class="bloghead"><a href="python-connect-four.php">Python CLI Connect Four </a></span><date>Jun 13, 2013</date></h3>
<p>Today I spent the majority of my free time creating a Connect Four game for the command line. I had the random idea for it and spent some time trying to figure out my method before beginning. I am a novice at Python so most of my problems lay in trying to figure out the syntax. Whenever I do any programming, I tend to have about thirty different tabs of Google open.</p>

<h3><span class="bloghead"><a href="set_srv_record_minecraft.php">How to set SRV records for Minecraft Servers </a></span><date>Feb 5, 2013</date></h3>
<p>I've read at least 6 or 7 bad articles on how to set up SRV records on GoDaddy's website, including the how-to from GoDaddy itself. They are all terrible. I had to piece together slivers of useful information and figure out how to set one up myself. After much suffering, cursing and drinking (OK maybe not drinking) I decided to create this article: "How to ACTUALLY set up SRV records".</p>
