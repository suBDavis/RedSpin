<h1>The Devolution of Social Media 
<date>Jul 19, 2013</date>
</h1>
There seems to be a trend in social media these days.  There have been no new sites that aim to provide a multitude of functions all wrapped into one experience, at least since the launch of Google+, and not successfully since the launch of internet empire Facebook .  Instead we are seeing services come out that provide only a few or even a single function.  A shining example of the devolution of social media is Vine, a program from independent developers that was purchased by Twitter.  With Vine, the user can create 6 second choppy videos and post them to their Vine and Twitter feeds as well as Facebook.  Instagram, a photo and video sharing application, has a very similar function.  Ask.fm is another very straightforward site whose sole purpose is to allow users to be asked questions by other users or anonymously.<br><br>

All of these sites and applications have a single purpose and they do what they do very well.  They can (and most often do) tie back to Twitter for maximum exposure.  So what do all of these micro-media apps have in common?  They allow the user to pick and choose how and where they post and consume various types of media, thereby custom building their own social network.  I find this model to be far superior to that of Facebook, where anything and everything can be spewed onto my news feed.  It's the difference between ordering a la carte or going to a pot luck supper.<br><br>

Another key difference in Facebook/Google+ and the newer players is the concept of time.  Facebook focuses mainly on the past while Twitter and the others are all about the present.  On Facebook, you can build huge picture archives.  You can connect with your old high school buddies and your profile page is known as a timeline.  I am more of a real-time fan.  I like getting the tweets and pictures and vines from the people that are currently in my life.  I like seeing content from the organizations and people I'm currently interested in.  I like the 140 character limit.  <br><br>

The truth is that both Facebook and Twitter are extremely useful in their own rights.  While I don't actually read the Facebook news feed, it's nice to have a huge archive of pictures from past experiences and a database of old friends.  I think of Facebook as an old warehouse where you can store experiences after they're over.  Twitter is for the living.
