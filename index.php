My name is Brandon Davis, and I'm a computer science student at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  I like to struggle with Java, PHP, and Python, and sometimes I even end up with runnable programs.  I am particularly interested in Linux and networking.  I also tinker with electronics, and I'm pretty fond of the Arduino platform. <a href='/me.php'>More About Me.</a>

I currently operate RedSpinMC, a public Minecraft server.  More info on that at <a href='http://rsmc.tk'>rsmc.tk</a>.  I'm also working on some small projects, including <a href="/blog/laserspacepong.php">Laser Space Pong</a> and a tool called <a href="https://github.com/suBDavis/FlashRemote">FlashRemote</a> which sends real-time key presses from a mobile device to any computer.  I just bought a <a href='http://www.raspberrypi.org/'>Raspberry Pi</a> to tinker with, and it runs this website.
